MERN stack:

1.React

Designed some pages/screes separately i.e. Home,login,signup
Created some components namely Navbar,Footer,Carosuel,Card
Placed these compoents on the Home screen
All the styling and structure is done using Bootstrap

2.MongoDB

Downloaded mongoose and signed up for mongodb atlas
Created a database called Cluster0 and uploaded some data on the cluster using connect method by connecting using a link provided by atlas(in the link add password and the database name)

3.Express 
Created a file containing express and linked the db in the file
Using this framework we are going to start the server and connect to the mongodb database
Using this we also include the creation of user 

4.Node 
Installed for backend and started a server side using nodemon server



In the backend folder,we've created a file called User.js for defining a schema of the data from user

Inside the routes folder,(CreateUser) file is created for applying validators and defined methods for creating a user account(Signup) and logging in

Then designed the SignUp and login page using React and included the handleSubmit method and onChange event(for dynamic input)
